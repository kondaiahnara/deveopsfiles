Here’s a comprehensive list of Maven interview questions and answers, categorized from basic to advanced, to help you prepare effectively:

⸻

Basic Maven Interview Questions

1. What is Maven?

Answer:
Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It manages project builds, dependencies, documentation, and reporting using a declarative XML file called pom.xml.

⸻

2. What are the advantages of using Maven?

Answer:
	•	Simplifies build management.
	•	Manages dependencies automatically.
	•	Provides standard project structure.
	•	Integrates with CI/CD tools easily.
	•	Offers plugins and goals for extended functionality.

⸻

3. What is a POM file in Maven?

Answer:
POM (Project Object Model) is an XML file (pom.xml) that contains project configuration details:
	•	Project information (name, version, description).
	•	Dependencies.
	•	Build configuration.
	•	Plugins and goals.

⸻

4. What is a Maven Repository?

Answer:
A Maven repository is a storage location for project artifacts and dependencies.
Types:
	•	Local Repository: Stored on the developer’s machine (~/.m2/repository).
	•	Central Repository: Hosted by Maven community.
	•	Remote Repository: Custom/private repositories like Nexus or Artifactory.

⸻

5. What is a Maven dependency?

Answer:
A dependency is an external library required by your project. Maven downloads these dependencies from repositories and stores them locally.

Example in pom.xml:

<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.13.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Intermediate Maven Interview Questions

6. What are Maven build life cycles?

Answer:
Maven has 3 built-in lifecycles:
	1.	Default Lifecycle: Handles project deployment (e.g., compile, test, package).
	2.	Clean Lifecycle: Cleans the project (mvn clean).
	3.	Site Lifecycle: Generates project documentation.

⸻

7. What are Maven goals?

Answer:
A goal is a task performed by Maven (e.g., compiling code, packaging a jar).
	•	Example: mvn clean runs the clean goal from the clean lifecycle.

⸻

8. What are dependency scopes in Maven?

Answer:
	•	compile (default): Available in all classpaths.
	•	provided: Required for compilation, not packaged (e.g., servlet-api in web apps).
	•	runtime: Needed during runtime (e.g., JDBC drivers).
	•	test: Used only during testing.
	•	system: Similar to provided, but explicitly points to a JAR on disk.
	•	import: Used for dependency management.

⸻

9. What is Maven’s dependency:tree command?

Answer:
It displays the dependency hierarchy of the project:

mvn dependency:tree

Useful for resolving conflicts in transitive dependencies.

⸻

10. What are transitive dependencies in Maven?

Answer:
Dependencies of your dependencies.
Example: If your project depends on Library A, and Library A depends on Library B, Maven includes Library B automatically.

⸻

11. How do you exclude a transitive dependency?

Answer:

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
  <version>5.3.30</version>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
      <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>



⸻

12. What is the difference between install and deploy in Maven?

Answer:
	•	install: Installs the built artifact into the local repository.
	•	deploy: Copies the artifact to a remote repository (e.g., Nexus/Artifactory).

⸻

Advanced Maven Interview Questions

13. How do you manage multi-module projects in Maven?

Answer:
	•	Create a parent POM and define submodules:

<modules>
  <module>module1</module>
  <module>module2</module>
</modules>

Each module will have its own pom.xml and inherit settings from the parent.

⸻

14. What is the difference between build and site in Maven?

Answer:
	•	Build: Compiles, tests, and packages code.
	•	Site: Generates project reports, documentation, and metrics.

⸻

15. What is the purpose of the dependencyManagement tag?

Answer:
It defines dependency versions in a parent POM, so child modules can use them without specifying versions.

⸻

16. What is the difference between Maven and Gradle?

Answer:
	•	Maven uses XML (pom.xml), Gradle uses Groovy/Kotlin DSL.
	•	Gradle is faster with incremental builds.
	•	Maven is more rigid but has better conventions.

⸻

17. What is the settings.xml file in Maven?

Answer:
Located in ~/.m2/, it defines:
	•	Repository locations.
	•	Credentials for remote repositories.
	•	Profiles for different build environments.

⸻

18. How do you run Maven in offline mode?

Answer:

mvn -o package

This uses only the local repository and doesn’t try to fetch dependencies online.

⸻

19. What is the difference between snapshot and release versions in Maven?

Answer:
	•	Snapshot: Under development (e.g., 1.0-SNAPSHOT), Maven checks for updates.
	•	Release: Stable and immutable (e.g., 1.0).

⸻

20. How do you integrate Maven with Jenkins?

maven install and Theory
Answer:
	•	Install Maven plugin in Jenkins.
	•	Configure Maven installation in Jenkins global settings.
	•	Create a pipeline/job and use:

mvn clean install



⸻

Practical Maven Commands:
	•	mvn clean: Remove target folder.
	•	mvn compile: Compile source code.
	•	mvn test: Run unit tests.
	•	mvn package: Package into JAR/WAR.
	•	mvn install: Install in local repo.
	•	mvn deploy: Push to remote repo.
